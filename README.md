# Stopwatch App | Timer

A simple stopwatch app made with Flutter. The app allows you to track time, record laps, and save lap records. It uses the `flutter_riverpod` package for state management.

## Features

- Start, stop, and reset the stopwatch.
- Record laps while the stopwatch is running.
- Save lap records with custom names.
- Search for lap records by name.

## Learning Experience
During the development of this app, I gained knowledge and hands-on experience in the following areas:

- State management using Riverpod.
- Generating unique IDs using the UUID package.
- Creating and working with class models.
- Implementing a search bar functionality.
  
I found these concepts to be valuable for building Flutter applications and enhancing the user experience. It was an exciting learning journey, and I look forward to applying these skills to future projects.
