A simple stopwatch app made with Flutter. The app allows you to track time, record laps, and save lap records. It uses the `flutter_riverpod` package for state management.

## Features

- Start, stop, and reset the stopwatch.
- Record laps while the stopwatch is running.
- Save lap records with custom names.
- Search for lap records by name.

## Usage
The app consists of two screens: the Timer screen and the Record screen.

- To start the stopwatch, tap the "Start" button.
- To stop the stopwatch, tap the "Stop" button.
- While the stopwatch is running, tap the "Lap" button to record a lap.
- To reset the stopwatch and clear all recorded laps, tap the "Reset" button.
- To save a lap, press and hold the desired lap record. Enter a custom name for the lap and tap the "Save" button in the dialog that appears.

## Learning Experience
During the development of this app, I gained knowledge and hands-on experience in the following areas:

- State management using Riverpod.
- Generating unique IDs using the UUID package.
- Creating and working with class models.
- Implementing a search bar functionality.
  
I found these concepts to be valuable for building Flutter applications and enhancing the user experience. It was an exciting learning journey, and I look forward to applying these skills to future projects.
